    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Game is hunted meat and includes rabbit, hare, pheasant, wild boar, and deer.</p>

        <p>There are around 6 types of deer in the UK that come under the name venison: fallow, roe, sika, red,
        muntjack, water. Other types include reindeer and caribou or moose that are eaten in colder areas of the world.</p>

        <p>When game is ready it’s referred to as “high” and should have a pungent gamey smell – it’s traditionally ready,
        or high, once the congealed blood starts to run again after the meat has broken down slightly meaning it’ll be 
        more tender.</p>

        <p>There is no taste difference between game that is in and out of season – it refers only to the sporting season.
        The sporting season relies on landowners’ rights which allow stock to breed at certain times of year in order
        to rear them to be ready grown in time for the next season.</p>

        <p>Poultry sizes referring to chickens in particular run from largest to smallest as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Capon</li>  
            <li>Boiling fowl</li>  
            <li>Poulet reine</li>   
            <li>Poulet grand</li> 
            <li>Double poussin</li>  
            <li>Poussin</li>  
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are two types of game – furred and feathered.</p>

        <p>Watling – refers to the red part around the eye of a male pheasant which attracts females.</p>

        <p>A pheasant’s spurs can indicate its age – a longer spur shows an older bird whose meat will be tougher and requires
            stewing of some sort. While it’s usually the breast that’s served, the thigh can also be confit-ed for tenderness.</p>

        <p>Other game birds include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quail</li>  
            <li>Squab – which is a fattened, poultrified pigeon (*the Brest pigeon is a protected regional trademark)</li>  
            <li>Partridge</li>   
            <li>Grouse (whose males have “hairy legs”)</li>  
            <li>Tarmigan (that have white coats for winter so as to be harder to spot in frosty climates)</li>  
            <li>Capercaillie – a type of grouse that lives in the forest and eats only pine</li>   
            <li>Snipe – a small, sparrow sized bird</li>   
            <li>Woodcock – blackbird sized protected species whose long bill is traditionally used to help with trussing – guts traditionally left in because it urinates and defecates during flight e.g. it cleans itself. This would only hang for 3-4 days.</li>  
            <li>Teal and Widgin – game ducks which are traditionally served “anglaise (with apple sauce) and française (with a bread croute, a farce à gratin and bread sauce)</li>  
        </ul>
