    <h2>Pork butchery demonstration</h2>
<p>This butchery demonstration was performed by the head of Owen Taylor, a local wholesale butchers 
    that supplies restaurants in this area. These are notes taken during the demonstration.</p>
<ul>    
    <li>To create a breeding pig takes from 1 year to 18 months, a gilt generally weighs around 70-80kg for this.</li> 
    <li>Female pigs generally have a smoother back end if it needs to be identified with boars having
    a rougher end where the testicles will have sat before slaughter. It is illegal to castrate before slaughter.</li>	
    <li>The butcher performing this demonstration preferred female pigs for the quality of the meat.</li>	
    <li>Fat – the millimetres of fat surrounding the meat helps to determine the grade of pork.</li>	
    <li>At slaughter, the tongue and offal is removed, so heads no longer come with them as a result of the 
    discovery of vCJD (something that the butcher dangerously referred to as a government conspiracy
    intended to control farmers, but is actually a life threatening neurodegenerative disease, based
    on naturally occurring protein misfolds “prions” that can be transmitted 
    and propagated through consumption, particularly of tissue containing these proteins e.g. brain
    and spinal tissue).</li>	
    <li>The spine is removed at slaughter because it turns green quickly.</li> 
    <li>The hock refers to the shin.</li>	
    <li>Gammon is hind leg meat whereas ham is cooked.</li>	
    <li>In poor quality meat the flesh is sloppy and a darker colour. This colour comes
    from a build up of lactic acid which causes the meat to degrade quicker.</li> 
    <li>The shoulder end is sweeter and more succulent.</li>	
<li>83-85kg pigs are about the right size for curing.</li>
</ul>
