    <h2>Soup terminology and notes</h2>
    <p>Stocks – 
        There are two types of meat stock, white and brown. They are
         comprised of soluble flavourings, nutrients and gelatine 
         derived from meat bones. The connective tissue in meat, such
          as the sinew and joints, contain collagen which renders down
           into gelatine but needs time to break down.</p>
           
           <p>To make a white stock, using chicken bones, you start by washing
         the bones, or blanching them. Place into a fresh pan of water,
          then bring to the boil and skim. Then replace the water, boil
           and leave to simmer for around 2 hours, skimming it regularly
            until you have a clear white stock, flavoured by the chicken.</p>
        
            <p>Brown stocks take considerably longer to achieve – taking around
         8 hours to cook. The difference in technique here is that the
          bones are roasted off first, rather than blanched, in order 
          to get Maynard reaction started (at around 50-150˚c) to impart
           a deeper flavour and colour into the stock.</p>
        
           <p>Typical brown stocks may be made from veal or beef etc. An example
         being estaphade, made from beef and pork. If reduced by half, this stock becomes
          a demi-glace, which can be used 
        as the base for many sauces, such as the sauce marchand de vin, made 
        during our hot sauces module. If reduced by half again, this becomes 
        a meat glaçe, which has a strength similar to that of a stock cube. This 
        can be used as such, or as a flavouring in another sauce or as a glaze,
         such as the glaze we put on the parmentier potatoes that garnished the
          pheasant we cooked during year 1 of this course.
          A vegetarian alternative to this may be a yeast extract, which
         results in a similar product when glazing.</p>
        
        <p>To make a fish stock takes significantly less time, using a white mirepoix,
         fish bones and white wine (along with other flavourings if desired). You 
         start by completely lining your stock pan with butter, brushing the 
         whole of the inside of the pan so that nothing sticks and starts to
          catch. This is to avoid producing a Maynard reaction and causing any
           browning or discolouration of the light stock. Once the pan has been
            lined, you sweat the mirepoix and fish bones lightly to get the 
            process started. In with this, we put 1 bay leaf, 4 white peppercorns, 
            parsley stalks, lemon juice, 100ml of white wine and 2 parts water. 
            This only takes around 20 minutes to cook, any more and the stock 
            begins to grey. Using this as the base for our fish soups, we also
             made a “fumet de poisson” which is a fish stock reduced by half, 
             to have at hand in case of the need to impart more flavour into a stock.
              Taken further, a fumet becomes a gla&#0231e, similar to a reduced meat gla&#0231e
               and similar in its gelatinous texture.</p>
          
               <p>You can make a vegetable stock by browning off the vegetables, a process called “dextronisation”.</p>
               
               <p>All stocks are seasoned after cooking, so that the correct level of saltiness
 is maintained and not intensified during reduction as a result of evaporating liquid.</p>

 <p>Consomm&#0233:</p>

<p>To ensure a consomm&#0233 remains clear after the cooking process, anything acidic needs to go in during 
the initial process because otherwise it will continue to react with the proteins and coagulate in the dish
making a cloudy spiral appear.</p>

<p>Pur&#0233e soups are always served with croutons.</p>

<p>Cream soups are always served with their garnish.</p>

<p>Flutes sometimes used instead of croutons are baguettes that are cut on a bias and toasted.</p>

<p>Despumation in consomm&#0233 production is the process of sitting a pan on 
a solid top with one half sitting on a hotter part so it boils and the raft goes over to the
 othe side of the pan (in an omelette shape). This is done so it can be skimmed more easily without breaking
 up the parts that have coagulated together.</p>
