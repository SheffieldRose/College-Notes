    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Sushi grade fish is frozen to kill any parasites
         (with the added bonus that tempering it makes the fish easier to cut.)
</p>

<p>A cross-section of lemon, in a slice with no rind is to
 be squeezed over the dish by the waiter using tongs.</p>

 <p>A wedge of lemon is to be served for the customer for them 
to squeeze over the dish themselves.</p>

<p>Farmed fish in close proximity to each other can get damaged 
and lead to infection whether bacterial or fungal.</p>

<p>Glace is a fully reduced fish stock. Without gelatine it is
 a fumée (double strength fish stock) or an essence.</p>

 <p>Oily fish bones contain oil and are bad for stock, furthermore,
 cod bones make fish stock go grey and should be avoided if you 
 want a nice, clear stock.</p>

 <p>Glazed and unglazed dishes are how fish dishes are split.</p>

 <p>Farce is a fish puree with cream whereas a mousseline has twice 
the amount of cream and has a lighter texture.</p>

<p>In a white fish the oil is in the liver – in an oily fish the
 oil is in the flesh. </p>

 <p>All oily fish are round, although white fish can be round or flat.</p>

 <p>Ammonia, is a by-product of fish breaking down – this is all fish.</p>

 <p>Cuts of fish:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Supr&#0234me</li> 
    <li>Darne</li>	
    <li>D&#0233lice</li>	
    <li>Paupiettes</li>	
</ul>

<p>Sea slime – this refers to the mucus excreted from the
 central nervous system of the fish which acts as a natural
  protective barrier. It’s a mild indicator of the freshness 
  of the fish provided that it smells fresh and is clean and 
  clear. If there is no “slime”, the fish may have been washed
   or may be older than expected as the mucus will as it will 
   start to break down after time meaning other indicators of
    freshness such as bright gills and eyes should be referred to.</p>
