    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        A couple of examples of canapés include:
        -	Bouch&#0233e – which is a bite sized puff pastry canapé
        -	Vol au vent – which is a large puff pastry canapé
        Canapés are traditionally served at the beginning of a French meal. 
        
    </p>
    <p>A similar equivalent in an English style service are “savouries” 
        which are served at the very end of a meal.
        Canapés can be accompanied by an aperitif which is a drink served
         at the start of a meal.</p>
    
         <p>Something such as Canapés Mephisto is still referred to as
         such even when served as a savoury as it is the proper name for the dish.</p>

         <p>When working with pastry we discussed the proteins present 
        in egg whites (and blood); albumins. When whipped the protein 
        holds its shape as the protein strands lengthen and lengthen
        , therefore trapping air within themselves.</p>

        <p>In a meringue, 
        the sugar helps to retain this structure. You can also add
         a drop of something acidic to help stretch the proteins even
          further to create even more opportunity to trap air and 
          make more bubbles.</p>
         
          <p>Adding an acid to a pastry mix containing slackens the proteins
 in the flour and therefore helps it to stretch further without
  overworking the gluten, tugging and toughening it up, which 
  causes the pastry to shrink during cooking. </p>
