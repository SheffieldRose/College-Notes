    <h2>Saut&#233 chicken chasseur</h2>
        <p>First, we cut a chicken for saut&#0233 by removing the parson’s nose, taking the wishbone 
        out, removing the wing tips, removing the wing, removing the legs and oyster, slicing down 
        between the middle of the cavity with the entire crown on top, then cutting it in half
        horizontally.
        </p>

        <p>Then we cut the feet from the legs and separated the drumstick and the 
        thigh bone.</p>

        <p>The carcass and winglets went to be frozen for future stock production and
        the saut&#0233 pieces were neatened up by trussing them with their own meat.</p>

        <p>These pieces were then coated in flour and deep fried in a sauteuse with enough oil 
        to fill the pan half-way. We fried these in oil that had been brought to a blue haze 
        and once the pieces were golden brown, put them in the oven to cook all the way through
        and become juicy and tender.</p>

        <p>In a different pan, while the chicken was cooking, we made the chasseur sauce by frying
        finely diced shallots and reducing with white wine.</p>
        
        <p>Once reduced, we added a demi-glace,
        sliced mushrooms and a tomato concasse.</p>  

        <p>We served this all together in one sharing dish with chopped parsley to garnish.</p>
