    <h2>Lamb butchery demonstration</h2>
    <p>This demostration was made by our course leader.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Lamb is sold from around 4 months to a year.</li> 
<li>Pauillac lamb (a PGI food such as Wensleydale etc.) from the Gironde is milk-fed lamb younger than 12 weeks weighing around 11-15kg, often used as a lamb equivalent to veal.</li>  	
<li>Salt-grass fed lamb is very savoury due to its diet.</li> 
<li>Category of lamb in order of age goes:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Lamb (1st year)</li>	
        <li>Hogget (2nd year)</li>	
        <li>Mutton (older than 2 years)</li>	
    </ul>
<li>Some names for sheep include:</li>
    <ul>       
        <li>Ewe (female)</li>	
        <li>Wether (castrated male)</li>	
        <li>Ram (male)</li> 
        <li>Tup (male sheep after first mating)</li>	
    </ul>	
<li>Sheep meat only hangs for around 4-5 days to condition and temper the meat – i.e. to make it go firmer and easier to handle. The fat renders and breaks down very quickly when warm so hanging helps.</li> 
<li>Joints from a butcher are then broken down into different chefs’ cuts.</li> 
<li>The middle neck on a sheep is like the best end but is located under the shoulder.</li> 	
<li>Suet is the fat from around the kidneys which holds them in place. To prepare it, boil it in water to clarify so that the fat floats and you can skim it off and use it for cooking.</li> 	
<li>The lungs, heart and liver make up the “pluck” which can be used to make haggis.</li>  	
<li>Drisheen is an Irish blood pudding which can contain sheep’s blood and is different to black pudding in texture as it is gelatinous.</li>  	
<li>Lamb and veal livers are mild and tender and are usually a chef’s preferred choice.</li>	
<li>All edible offal (abats in French) is slashed upon slaughter and inspected for tumours and worms etc.</li> 
<li>A “strap” or “cannon” is a loin cut stripped of fat.</li>	
<li>A “gigot” (fr) or “gigget” (scots) is the leg of a lamb.</li>	
<li>On a fillet, different sections are named differently.</li>	
<li>A cutlet is a slice from the middle neck.</li>	
<li>A chop is a slice from the bottom end, including the loin section to make a French tip.</li>	
<li>A shoulder shank is very sinewy like the shin from beef.</li>	
<li>The “dressing out percentage” is the amount of useable meat after the cut has been boned out.</li>	
<li>To make an “epigram”, an Edwardian dish, the lamb breast is first boned, rolled, cooked, unrolled, breadcrumbed and fried. When taken from the saddle, a rolled piece is called a noisette.</li>	
<li>The names attributed to sections of the sheep are in order from the neck:</li>	
    <ul>
        <li>Scrag end</li> 
        <li>Middle neck</li>	
        <li>Best end</li> 
        <li>Saddle (you can get the loin and chops from the saddle)</li>
    </ul>
<li>When trimming the bone off the spine so that the spine is fully flush, it’s referred to as chine.</li>	
<li>A couronne d’aigneau is two racks tied together in a crown shape.</li>
<li>A guard d’honneur is two racks tied like the interlocking fingers of two hands pressed against each other.</li>
</ul>
