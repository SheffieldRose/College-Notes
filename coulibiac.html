    <h2>Coulibiac</h2>
    <p>Eastern European in origin this dish comprises baked fish which has been filleted, skinned, pinned, stuffed and marinated.
The components of this dish, which we made individually were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Duxelles mushroom</li>
    <li>Cache de riz</li>
    <li>Savoury cr&#0234pe</li>
    <li>Trout fillet</li>
    <li>Nori sheets</li>
</ul>

<p>Duxelles mushroom <br>
In a pan we put finely chopped shallot, chopped button mushrooms (fine but big enough to add a good texture), and a finely chopped small sprig of thyme, then fried it all lightly to induce a slight Maynard reaction on the vegetables. In order to finish the duxelles, we added a drop of cream, a drop of white wine and a pinch of finely chopped parsley and set aside to cool and then placed in the fridge until construction of the dish.
</p>

<p>Cache de riz <br>
This we made from braising rice before stuffing the fish. We finely chopped a shallot and quickly fried to begin the Maynard process, adding flavour to the pan. To this we added a handful of rice, two parts stock to water and a sprig of thyme. We then covered with a cartouche and a lid and braised this on the hot plate until cooked through and al dente, then added a fine brunoir of red and green bell pepper and chopped tarragon.
</p>

<p>Savoury cr&#0234pe <br>
To make this we combined these ingredients in a mixing bowl before frying in a shallow pan:
<br>
Finely chopped thyme
<br>
Two eggs
<br>
A drop of oil
<br>
Salt and pepper
<br>
A tablespoon of cream
<br>
Strong flour bit by bit until the mixture gained a thickness similar to double cream
<br>
Finely chopped thyme 
<br>
Finely chopped chives
</p>

<p>Trout fillets <br>
To do this we broke the fish down in sections as follows:
<br>
Head off
<br>
Guts out
<br>
Descale with the back of a knife so as not to damage skin
<br>
Cut down length of spine just on either side of the spine
<br>
Pin using fish tweezers
<br>
Trim off fat from belly edge of fillet
<br>
Skin
</p>

<p>Nori sheet
<br>
We used shop-bought sheets of nori seaweed to add texture and flavour to the dish.</p>

<p>Boiled egg
<br>
We put 8-10 eggs in boiled water until solidly cooked through, then grated.
<br>
N.B. the skin between the shell and flesh of an egg is called the epithelium.</p>

<p>Putting the coulibiac together - the steps we followed were as below: 
<br>
Sandwich the grated egg and some duxelles between the two fish fillets.
<br>
Wrap the fillet sandwich tightly in nori.
<br>
Wrap this in the savoury herb cr&#0234pe.
<br>
Roll out puff pastry, leaving enough room for edges once fish roll is placed on top. Roll one edge of the puff pastry thinner than the others to create a delicate seal for the pastry roll when rolling and sealing the fish inside
<br>
Before placing the fish onto the pastry, create a layered bed of duxelles then rice, leaving room for it to go all the way around the fish
<br>
Wrap fish in the pastry/duxelles/rice layer and seal on thin edge with water.
<br>
Finish by wrapping in pastry layer cut into crosshatch shape and glaze with an egg wash, then bake until cooked through.
