    <h2></h2>
    <p>To make a consomm&#0233, you need to clarify the liquid to be a nice, 
    crystal clear, deep, black tea colour. Starting with a brown stock as 
    described above , we used a mix of minced beef, chicken bones and egg
    whites to create a protein raft which we used to collect the
    impurities in the soup.</p>

    <p>To ensure a more complex and enjoyable flavour in the consomm&#0233,
    we flavoured the stock by adding 1000g chicken bones, 250g mirepoix
    then removed it and cooled, then put 500g of the bones and all the
    mirepoix through the mincer with bouquet garni herbs , 8 peppercorns 
    and 1 heaped tbsp tomato purée. Once we had done this, we added 5 egg
    whites to the mix and put this back into the stock stirring to ensure 
    all the solids were evenly dispersed and suspended inside the liquid.</p>

    <p>We then brought the consomm&#0233 to a light simmer to achieve
    a process of despumation, whereby we placed one half of 
    the pan onto a hotter part of the solid top than the other half so it
    boils and folds over onto the cooler half of the pan, rendering it 
    easier to skim.</p>
    
    <p>Once the raft had gathered all of the impurities in 
    the stock and left it crystal clear, we skimmed all of the solids from
    the soup and passed it through a muslin over a chinois, then reboiled 
    to ensure further clarity.</p>

    <p>We served the soup in a large serving dish 
    containing 4 portions worth (around a litre of consomm&#0233) of soup and
    presented with a julienne of swede, celeriac, carrot and green and white
    of leek, which we had blanched to stop from floating on top of the soup.
    We used beef bones, roasted off and simmered for 8 hours. We did this
    a week in advance and stored the stock in the fridge, then freezer to
    ensure we were prepared with the consommés ingredients on the day of making.</p>

    <p>By mincing the beef, chicken bones and whisking the egg whites, the
    proteins in the mix become denatured – the state in which cooking processes 
    such as emulsion or clarification begin. By denaturing the proteins,
    they open up and become prone to binding with other materials, in order
    to stabilise. In consommé, this is very visible in the formation of the
    raft.</p>

    <p> While the minced mix is suspended and almost completely unbound
    in the consommé, it gradually groups together and forms a raft of solids
    on top of the liquid. During the process, the proteins gather everything 
    up from the liquid to become part of this raft, and the liquid remains
    crystal clear, free from any floating pieces.
    </p>

    <p>Herbs included in a bouquet garni are : thyme, parsley and bay leaf, although
    there may be variations. This can be made using a “plochette” which is a muslin
    pocket, or a “herb faggot” which is made of a leaf of leek folded around herbs.</p>
